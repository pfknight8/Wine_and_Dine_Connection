## Descripton

#### The Wine and Dine Collection is a database that will allow users to connect wine pairings to food. The databse of wines will allow users full CRUD for various bottles of wine, while the meal side will allow users full CRUD control over meal postings. The meal side is the main focus, and users can call up a list of wines to pair with a seleched meal.
#### This project was built over the course of a week. Phase 1 was strictly planning, spanning Friday evening (7/22/22) to Monday morning (7/25/22). Coding then began and proceeded until the bitter end, 1:30pm on the following Friday (7/29/22). Future edits may come to improve functionality and keep up my skills, which will be noted in the future updates section.
