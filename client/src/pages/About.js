      <h1>About This Site</h1>
      <p>This site was created by me, Patrick Knight, as part of an immersive bootcamp in software engineering. It constitutes my second project, a full-stack web application with full CRUD capabilities.<br />This project was built over the course of a week. Phase 1 was strictly planning, spanning Friday evening (7/22/22) to Monday morning (7/25/22). Coding then began and proceeded until the bitter end, 1:30pm on the following Friday (7/29/22). I intend to edit this project into a more impressive portfolio piece after the course, if time will allow.<br />Why wine you ask? My family has been in the beverage industry for some time, so I grew up around craft beers and fine wine. My wife, Tara, having a passion for fine foods, it made sense to pick this as a topic, bringing my familial background into my work. While not as extensive as it could be (due to the constraints of time), it was a fun project to build, and a great way to build my skills as a programmer.</p>
